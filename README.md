# ESG Score Prediction: Machine Learning-Based Regression Analysis

This project focuses on predicting Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) scores using machine learning regression models. ESG scores are crucial for assessing corporate sustainability and social responsibility.

## Features
- **Data-Driven Insights**: Utilizes structured data for ESG score prediction.
- **Regression Models**: Implements regression techniques for accurate predictions.
- **Notebook Implementation**: Provides an easy-to-follow Jupyter Notebook for analysis.
- **Actionable Predictions**: Generates insights to aid decision-making for ESG investments.

## Installation

To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/teckyonAI/ESG_Score_Prediction.git
